# Why do we need a time-series database?

 To Know why do we need a time-series database, we should firstly know what is time-series data. Time-series data is a series of data tagged with time stamp. So where is the data from? Mostly, the Internet of thing, also big data. It’s hugely different from traditional data. Traditional data almost remain the same volume recent years while Internet of thing data is booming rapidly. There are some characteristics of the data. First, it’s timestamped data and structured data. Second, data source is like a stream, which means data colume is continously increasing. Third, the data is mainly immutable. So after the data was produced, we can't change the data. Fourth, the data rate is stable. Fifth, we mostly do writting operation more than reading operation, and we rarely delete or update the data. Besides, it always require real-time data computing and the query is in-time and space ranged. 

  There is a huge need for time-series data. In the following scenario, especially in the IOT Internet of things and OPS operation and maintenance monitoring field, there is a large amount of monitoring data that needs to be stored and managed. Manufacturing: for example, the lightweight production management cloud platform uses the Internet of things and big data technology to collect and analyze all kinds of time series data generated in the production process, and present the production progress, goal achievement status, and the utilization status of people, machines, and materials at the production site in real time, so as to make the production site completely transparent and improve production efficiency. Bank Finance: the trading system of traditional securities and emerging encrypted digital currency, which collects and analyzes the time series data generated in the trading process to realize financial quantitative trading. Devops: IT infrastructure and application operation and maintenance system, collect and analyze equipment operation and application service operation monitoring indicators, and master the health status of equipment and applications in real time. Social media: social app big data platform, which tracks user interaction data, analyzes user habits, and improves user experience; The live broadcast system collects the monitoring index data of the anchor, audience and intermediate links in the live broadcast process to monitor the live broadcast quality. Health care: business intelligence tools, collect health data in smart watches and smart bracelets, and track key indicators and the overall health of the business. Smart home: the home Internet of things platform collects data from smart home devices to realize remote monitoring. Network: network monitoring system, which presents network delay and bandwidth usage in real time.

  The purpose of time series analysis is to find out the statistical characteristics and development regularity of the time series within the sample, build a time series model, and predict outside the sample. The time series are required to be stable when establishing the model, but the time series actually analyzed, especially those from the economic field, are mostly non-stationary. These non-stationary time series often have some typical data characteristics. When building the model, we often consider the appropriate time series model according to the data characteristics of the series.

  Because of the characteristics of time-series data above, we require a database with following functions. It must be real time alerted, for the operation of query is always in-time and the data is produced every seconds or minutes. It must has a function to forecassting. On the one hand, such a function could provide the infomation for users. On the other hand, the database would get to know how much data will influxed. It must have insights of operation. It must identifying the problems.

  Now, let's see tradional tools for processing time-series data. Only after we know the shortcomings of them,  we can clear out why time-series database is needed.

  Firtly, relational database. Those databases include Oracle, MySQL, SQLserver and so on. Relational database uses relational model to organize the data and uses primary key to identify a tuple. To use relational database for handling time-series data, we are supposed to use Range Partition. For example, we devide the data according the date and One day or one hour is included only in one table. Though there exist some pros. The team is familiar with the relevant tools. It leverage exsiting computing and storage resource. However, there are more cons. As data increases, processing becomes increasingly complex. The performance of writing and querying is poor. It's complicated to manage.

  Secondly, NoSQL database. NoSQL database, which also means not only SQL,  has varieties of models to store data and retrive. We can choose Key-Value, Colume-Family, Graph or Document to organize our data. The advantages of NoSQl to process time-series data are the same with relational database. Both of them reduce the cast of learning and fully use of exsiting tools. And weaknesses also exsit here. The processing becomes increasingly complex when data increases. It's not very convient to use and this kind of database potentially increase the cost of  storage.

  Thirdly, Realtime database. Realtime database uses realtime processing to handle workloads whose state is constantly changing. It's always used in sceneries like stock market, where the state of data changes rapidly and requires keep track of current values for all of the change. Realtime processing means that a teansaction is processed fast enough for the result to come back and be acted on right away.

  Fouthly, General Big Data platform. Big Data platform is similar to time-series database at some points. Both of have to handle amout of data like seas. However, Big Data platform often handle  data more complex than time-series database. Because Big Data comes from kinds of terminals at the same time while time-series database always receive single structured data. As a result, General Big Data Platform is inefficient in reading, operating, organizing and takes longer time to market.

  Above all, many of the shortcomings comes from the technical challenges of time-series data processing. The data volume is huge for it's generated automatically in most cases. The volume of data is  growing exponentially. It has realtime requirements and latency is critical in many scenarios. And application always require multi-dimensional analysis. It should also be easily integrated with third party tools for  diverse application. So we need a purpose-built database to prosee time-series data.

  Time series database has the following obvious characteristics: all collected data are the only data source of each collection point of time series. Usually, data will not be deleted or modified. Data storage generally has retention period settings. Deleting data according to date is mainly written. Query operations are mainly performed according to the specified time period. Analysis often requires statistics of stored data Aggregation and other real-time calculations store a huge amount of data. All of them are adapted for the characteristics of time-series data.

  Compared with relational database, time series database generally has a high data compression rate. Even in the case of massive data storage, the data can be compressed and stored, and the storage cost is very low. This is due to the storage mode of time series database, which generally adopts column storage. And the writing performance is better. Even in the case of massive devices and test points, it can still have excellent performance. The data acquisition frequency of time series database is fast, and the amount of data stored is also huge. Users can generally set the retention period of data according to their business requirements, such as 10 years and 50 years. Generally, data retention time is not specially set in the relational database.

  There I will show a example which time-series database play a great role.With the increasing proportion of wind power in the national energy structure, higher and higher requirements are put forward for the automatic operation level of wind farms. At present, the large capacity data storage of fan monitoring system generally adopts relational database (such as Oracle), which requires large capacity disk array equipment. The data sampling period of the fan monitoring system is generally seconds or even milliseconds (the shortest is 200 milliseconds), so the demand for disk space will increase exponentially. At present, the capacity of ordinary disk arrays is difficult to meet the storage needs of the above massive data. Disk array devices need to be added over time, which will lead to the continuous increase of storage costs. For the demand of real-time, high-frequency and mass storage of fan monitoring system, only time-series database technology can meet the requirements. Time series databases generally adopt efficient compression storage algorithms, such as the well-known PI database in the industry, which adopts data compression and filtering technology, which greatly saves disk space. The fan monitoring system needs to provide data access services for the upper level monitoring, statistics, analysis, management and other advanced applications. Such as high-density trend curve, which is used to display real-time change trend of data; High resolution fan fault data record is used for process inversion after fan fault; Power quality monitoring with high sampling rate is used to analyze the quality of grid connected power. These advanced applications not only require the system to provide massive storage space is used to store comprehensive and complete data for a long time, which requires the system to have extremely high data access performance and be able to obtain the required data section at the second level or even the millisecond level. The current relational database is not competent for this important task. The massive data storage and fast data access capabilities provided by the time series database provide an ideal solution for many advanced applications of the fan monitoring system.
